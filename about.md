Hi, I'm Nick Wormley.<br>
I've been making a living writing software for a very long time,
and of the many many things I've learned, code that can't
effectively be reasoned about will ultimately lead to a bad experience
for the user, which means anxiety for the programmer.
With that realization, I've spent much time developing techniques
to make it easier to reason about code, so that it becomes much more
difficult to do the wrong thing.<br>
First and foremost in my toolbox is the functional programming
language Haskell, but I find
that the kinds of thinking that are encouraged by Haskell can often
be adapted to programming problems in *any* language.<br>
I'm hoping that some of these ideas will become visible through my
work on this site.<br>
Thanks for reading!
