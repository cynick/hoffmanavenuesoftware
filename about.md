Hi, I'm Nick Wormley.<br>
I've been making a living writing software for a very long time.<br>
Somewhere along the way, I started noticing that 'new'
programming technologies seemed to be more and more complicated and
further away from the mathematical foundations of computing, while
I was always yearning for the exact opposite!<br>
<p>
Fortunately for me, in 2008 I rediscovered for myself the joys of Functional
Programming, and turned all of my sails in that direction.
Nearly ten years on, it is gratifying to see ideas from the functional
paradigm filtering down into mainstream languages, and at a rather
accelerated pace at that.<br>
It's an exciting time to be involved in software, that's for sure!
