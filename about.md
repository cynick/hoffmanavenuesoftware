Hi, I'm Nick Wormley.<br>
I've been making a living writing software for a very long time.<br>
Somewhere along the way, it occurred to me that 'new'
programming technologies seemed to be getting ever further away from
mathematical foundations of computing, while I was always yearning for
the exact opposite!<br>
Fortunately for me, in 2008 I rediscovered for myself the joys of Functional
Programming, and turned all of my sails in that direction.
Nearly ten years on, it is gratifying to see ideas from the functional
paradigm filtering down into mainstream languages, and at a rather
accelerated pace at that.<br>
It's an exciting time to be involved in software, that's for sure!
